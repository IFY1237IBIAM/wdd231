        Project Subject 
Subject: A Travel Blog focusing on Destination Guides and Travel Tips.

2. Project Description 
The website will feature destination guides for popular travel locations, travel tips for budget-friendly adventures, and a gallery showcasing beautiful landscapes. The site will include a blog section where users can read personal travel stories, along with a form allowing visitors to submit their own stories. It will also incorporate a weather API to provide real-time weather updates for featured destinations.

3. Project Reason and Purpose 
I chose this subject because of my personal interest in travel and the opportunity to engage a broad audience with valuable content. The project allows me to integrate dynamic web development skills, such as API integration, JavaScript functionality, and responsive design, while creating a website that could help inspire others to explore new places.
4. Scenarios:
Scenarios represent questions from potential site visitors, guiding the content toward addressing the needs of the target audience. Examples include:
What are the top budget-friendly destinations in Abuja?
How can I find real-time weather information for my next travel location?
